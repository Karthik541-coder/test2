# CivicChain — On-Chain Citizen Budget Participation Platform

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Local governments spend taxpayer money without sufficient public transparency or citizen participation, leading to mistrust and inefficiency in public fund usage.

---

## 💡 Solution
CivicChain empowers citizens by distributing voting tokens (Algorand Standard Assets - ASAs) based on residency or tax contribution. Citizens vote on municipal budget proposals through a DAO built on the Algorand blockchain. Funds are automatically disbursed via smart contracts only if proposals meet the required quorum.

---

## 🤝 User Value
- Direct citizen participation in local governance
- Transparent, verifiable budget usage
- Increased public accountability for government spending

---

## 🔗 Algorand Ecosystem Value
- Real-world DAO application showcasing Algorand’s strengths
- Uses ASAs for voting tokens and PyTeal smart contracts for fund disbursement logic
- Demonstrates scalable, low-cost blockchain governance for the public sector

---

## 🚀 Purpose & Vision
Create a trustless, transparent budgeting platform that bridges governments and citizens, promoting democratic governance and responsible public spending.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
| Layer            | Technologies / Tools                         |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Smart Contracts   | PyTeal (via AlgoKit)                         |
| Tokenization     | Algorand Standard Assets (ASA)               |
| Voting Logic     | Beaker Framework + Algorand Stateful Contracts|
| Wallet Integration| Pera Wallet + WalletConnect (React)          |
| Frontend         | React, Tailwind CSS, Algorand SDK             |
| Storage (Optional)| IPFS (for proposals and documents)           |

## ⚙️ Using AlgoKit
This project leverages AlgoKit to simplify Algorand smart contract development, testing, and deployment, speeding up the MVP development and enhancing scalability.

## 📦 Features (MVP)
| Feature              | Purpose                                    |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Proposal Creation    | Admins submit municipal budget proposals  |
| Token Distribution  | Voting tokens assigned to verified citizens|
| On-Chain Voting     | DAO-based voting with quorum verification  |
| Fund Release Logic  | Smart contract automates fund disbursement |
| Public Dashboard    | Real-time visibility of proposals and results |

---

## 🧭 MVP Workflow
1. Admin Council creates a budget proposal (e.g., ₹5L for road repairs)
2. Citizens receive voting tokens (ASAs)
3. Citizens cast votes on proposals via the DAO
4. If quorum is met, smart contract releases funds to the project
5. Dashboard updates public records transparently

---

## 📈 Startup Potential & Impact
- Addresses a real problem of transparency in government spending
- Encourages grassroots civic participation and public accountability
- Scalable from local bodies to large municipalities
- Potential SaaS model for governments, NGOs, and civic organizations
